## 4 Steps to Solve Any Problem

1. make sure you understand 100% of the problem

- ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
- eg: 'what to do if something else is passed in?'

2. Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems

- e.g., check if argument is a number, string or an array
- e.g., implement reversing a #

3. Don't be afraid of research.

4. For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing actual code
