## 4 Steps to Solve Any Problem

1. make sure you understand 100% of the problem

- ask the right questions to get a clear picture of the problem
- eg: 'what to do if something else is passed in?'

2. Divide and conquer: Break a big problem into smaller sub-problems

- e.g., check if argument is a number, string or an array
- e.g., implement reversing a #

3. Don't be afraid of research.

4. For bigger problems, write pseudo-code before writing actual code

- Review of JS behind the hood, largely theory-based
- Reviewed Hoisting
- typing 'window' in the Dev Console shows all the properties of an element
- 'THIS' keyword
- Primitives, Objects and JS Engine

---

- Primitives: number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, BigInt
- Objects (Reference types): Object literal, arrays, function.. and many more

- JS Engine: Two Components: Call Stack and the Heap...
- 1.) All Objects are stored in the 'Heap'
- 2.) Primitives are stored in the 'Call Stack' because this is where Execution Context run

- \*\*\* YOU CAN CHANGE 'const' VARIABLES WHEN USING REFERENCE VALUES !!!
- ** 'const' variable is ONLY immutable with PRIMITIVE VALUES \_**
